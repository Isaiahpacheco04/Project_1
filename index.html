    <h1>Welcome to My Home Page</h1>
    <p>Hey, I’m Isaiah Pacheco. This is my simple HTML project with no CSS or extras  just basic pages showing a bit about me and what I’m into.</p>

    <h2>Gallery</h2>

    <h3>LEGO Collection</h3>
    <img src="media/lego-collection.jpg" alt="LEGO sets on shelves" width="300">
    <p>I’ve been into LEGO for years. I mainly collect Star Wars and Ninjago sets, and I’m always working on organizing or rebuilding stuff in my collection.</p>

    <h3>Coding and Tech</h3>
    <img src="media/coding-setup.jpg" alt="Laptop screen with code and a pair of glasses" width="300">
    <p>I’m studying IT, so I spend a lot of time learning how to code and trying new tools. Projects like this one help me practice and figure things out hands-on.</p>

    <h3>Fitness</h3>
    <img src="media/gym.jpg" alt="Bench press with plates and a bottle" width="300">
    <p>Outside of school and work, I hit the gym pretty often. It helps me stay consistent and focused, and it’s something I really enjoy keeping up with.</p>
